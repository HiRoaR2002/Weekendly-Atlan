## üß† Core Concepts

The application's logic is built around a few key concepts that work together to provide a seamless experience.

### 1. Activity & Theme Definitions (`src/constants.js`)

All available activities and themes are statically defined in `src/constants.js`.

- **Activities:** Individual items with properties like `id`, `name`, `duration`, `vibe`, and `icon`. They are grouped into categories (e.g., "Food & Drinks," "Outdoor Adventures").
- **Themes:** Pre-packaged collections of activity IDs that create a specific weekend experience (e.g., "Lazy Weekend").

### 2. Centralized State Management (`src/hooks/useWeekendPlanner.js`)

A single powerful React hook, `useWeekendPlanner`, acts as the "brain" of the application. It manages:

- The user's current view (`browse`, `plan`, `share`).
- The list of activities in the temporary `activityBucket`.
- The final `scheduledActivities` for each day.
- Weather data and smart recommendations.
- All business logic, including drag-and-drop handling and conflict detection.

### 3. Application Views (`src/components/views/`)

The user journey is split into three main views:

- **`BrowseView`:** Displays all themes and activities from `constants.js`, allowing users to add them to the `ActivityBucket`.
- **`PlanView`:** The main scheduling interface where users arrange activities on a timeline, see weather forecasts, and adjust their plans.
- **`ShareView`:** Presents a final, beautifully formatted summary of the plan, ready to be exported or shared.
